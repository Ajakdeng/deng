          <p>
            Every saturday and sunday, I always try to ensure that all the assigned works are finished before the new Week
            begins. This is to ensure that procastination doesn't come in to cause some delays will later on result to last
            minute pressure. This practice has saved me in many occassion and I love it.

        </div>
        <p>
          I am one of the enthusiastic guys when it comes to playing chess game. Every weekend, I try to give myself sometime 
          to solve some intriquing puzzles. Chess.com is my favorite web-site for playing chess. I started playing chess a few months ago 
          but now, I have seen significant improvement in my tactical play and problem solving. This is the power of consistency

        <h3>Watching Soccer</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Another game I like to watch is football. I am a big supporter of English premier league. I do support Arsenal FC.
        I fell in love with Arsenal Fc because of Thiery Henry during his prime time at Arsenal. His goal scoring ability used to 
        always put joy in as a kid. From that time till now, I have remained a very good fan of Arsenal FC. Because of this, I always find 
        time to watch any football match for Arsenal FC.
